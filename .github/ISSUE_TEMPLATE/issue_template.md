### What helps Claude Code work efficiently

1. **Be specific** - "Button doesn't save" vs "Add save functionality" mean different things
2. **Define done** - Acceptance criteria prevent back-and-forth
3. **Mention files** - If you know which files are involved, say so
4. **State constraints** - "Don't add new dependencies" or "Must work with existing auth flow"
5. **Include reproduction steps** - For bugs, show how to trigger the issue
